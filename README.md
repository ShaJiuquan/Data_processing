# Machine learning for scanning tunnelling microscopy

## STM Data management and vilization

The data collected from STM,there are three type of stm data : stm image stm spec and stm grid with the format of .sxm .dat .3ds reperenetly for nanonix

## Abstract

The wide utilization of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has revolutionized the fields ofsurface science, materials science and nanotechnology.The capability ofvisualizing and manipulating individual atomsmakes it a powerful tool for studying the surface reconstruction,single moleculein-situ reaction and quantum device construction.However, because of the complex of STM operation and the presence of noise and artifacts in the STM images, either the collection or the interpretation of STM images is time-consuming and heavily contingent upon experience of the expertise in this field. In addition,the large amounts of data generated by STM can be overwhelming and difficult to analyze using traditional methods, motivating development of highly automated instruments and effective image analysis. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have developed rapidly and already proved to be speeding up the data collection and analysis process. Due to its ability to analyze large amount of data, recognize patterns, and make predictions based on that data. With the help of machine learning algorithms, newopportunities areemerging at the interface between STM and machine learning (ML) methods. Here, we review the recent progress of implementing machine leaching techniques in improving the efficiency of STM controlling and data analysis, including the entire workflow of data collection and data analysis and discuss methods and resources potential to solve the problems in the process of autonomous operation, high throughput data acquirement, and data analysis of STM.

## Introduction

    STM is a powerful tool which can image and manipulate atom  and linkage the structural and electronic information in the atomic scale, which have revolutionized many fields such as physics, material science and nanotechnology. It is a type of scanning probe microscope, in contrast with optical microscope, scanning tunneling microscope apply a tip scanning above  conducting materials and recode the current tunnelling from the surface of the sample, which can reflect the surface profile of the sample. So that it can image
