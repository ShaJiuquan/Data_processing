## INTRODUCTION

    Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is atype of advancedmicroscope used to study the surfaces of conducting materialsto atom scale. The powerful ability to uncover the linkage between the structural and the electronic information, combining with the capability of manipulating individual atoms and molecules, have been leading to revolutionizedadvancements in fields such as surface science, nanotechnology, and materials science,making it a valuable toolforstudying chemical reactions,designing new materials and devices with desired properties, manipulating and controllingquantum states.

    Different from optical microscope, STM is a kind of microscope applying anextremely sharp metal tip kept close to the surface of conductive materials, andwitha small bias voltage, the current tunnels between the tip and the surface through the ‘vacuum layer’,which directly reflect the profile of the sample surface. Owing to the highly localized nature of the tunnelling current(The tunnelling current increases exponentially as the distance between them decreases), atomically resolved images could be obtained by raster-scanning the tip over the surface while using a feedback loop to keep the tunnelling current constant.In terms of the local electronic structure of the sample,it can be achieved bySTM with recording the resultant change in current, modulating the voltage applied to the tip, whilethe feedback loop uses the measuredcurrent to adjust the tip-sample distance and keeping the tip at fixed distance from the surface in real time.Atoms manipulation can be manipulated by applying a voltage pulse to STM tip, which induces an electric field strong enough to attract or repel individual atoms on the surface. By carefully controlling the voltage and positioning of the tip, atoms can be moved, or added to the surface.

    Although the precise control and data acquire systemthe STM have equipped,because ofthe variant of the tips,drift, electronic noise andexternal vibration,different types of artefacts and high-level noise are usually present in the STM images. the damage of the tips such as the tips-sample interaction or crashing can cause irregular variation in tunnellingcurrent, leading to artefacts in the STM images. Drift and electronic noise in the STM system can also contribute to the noise in the image.External vibration can cause the tip to move and result in blurred or distorted images.    Therefore, the STM typically comes equipped with ultrahigh vacuum system and vibration isolation tables, which serve to eliminate external vibrations and surface contamination.Surface cleaningtechniqueslikesputtering and thermal annealing are available used to achieve atomic flat sample.

    However, obtaining high-resolution images in STM muchmore than that. The sharpness of the tip, which allows for atomic-scale resolution imaging and manipulation of the sample surface, is hard to optimize and easily gets damaged during the process of data acquirement, producing tips capable of atomic resolutions is time-consuming and highly relies on the experience and intuition of experts.The tip-sample distance and the feedback control system are also important factors that contribute to the stability and precision of the STM measurement. The accurate measurement of tunnelling current and the precise maintaining of tip-distance should be guaranteed to achieve high-resolution STM images. In practice, various sets of parament will be tried and adjusted manually based on the operator's experience to keep the STM in the best status, including conditioning the STM tip to maintain sharp enough to get the atomically resolved image and selecting the proper region to avoid the damage of the tip.In terms of data analysis, images with artefacts and noise are always hard to analyze, although tools are available to process the STM images, such as Gwydion,WSXM, and SPIP, such packages require a user to decide how to processand extract statistics from the data, and domain knowledge is highly needed to in this process, batch processing, such as subtracting a fitted plane from all images and exporting to a suitable image file in these packages, are available which can greatly improves the speed of processing for sets of similar images and save amounts of time in STM processing, it requires time to manually sort the images, and decide on the processing needed and dealing with the low-quality data is still a challenge. Therefore, it is important to carefully control the experimental conditions and use appropriate image processing techniques to reduce noise and artifacts in STM images.

   The application of machine learning to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has emerged as a promising tool to assist in the collection and analysis of STM data. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning. The use of machine learning in STM analysis has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data interpretation, particularly in cases where the data is noisy or difficult to interpret using traditional analysis methods.Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze STM images and extract information about the electronic and structural properties of materials. Al algorithms can be used to predict the behavior of atoms and molecules on surfaces, helping researchers to design new materials and devices with specific properties. Machine learning and AI algorithms are playing increasing important role in addressing these challenges. As these technologies continue to advance, they will likely enable new discoveries and applications in the fields of surface science and nanotechnology. It can help to reduce the time and the cost of experiments, enable the discovery of new materials or phenomena, and provide a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry of the system being studied. Additionally, the combination of machine learning with advanced instrumentation such as STM can provide a powerful new tool for materials design and discovery. The ability of machine learning algorithms to analyze images consistently, objectively, quickly, and adaptively makes them superior to humans in many images analysis tasks.

    Recent advances in machine learning, particular in deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have enable the development of more sophisticated algorithms for analyzing STM data. These algorithms can be trained on large datasets of STM images, allowing them to recognize patterns and extract useful information from the data.
